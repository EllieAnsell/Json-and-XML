# Json-and-XML
WIP files used in a programming assignment, year 3 at Bournemouth University. 

__My Role:__ I'm part of a team of 7 students working on creating a shader manager. My role is to use methods to parse between files, making it easy to read and write files between formats to be used elsewhere. I used Json and XML (although only one is really needed, I used both to determine which I preferred).
